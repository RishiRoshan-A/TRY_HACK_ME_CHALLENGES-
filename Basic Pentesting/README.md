## Lets with the nmap scan 

![img](1.png)

We found six open ports lets perform service version detection scan and default script scan on them

![img](2.png)

![img](3.png)

Lets vistis the site running on port 80 

![img](4.png)

Lets use gobuster to enemurate the web directories

![img](5.png)

we found a path /development , lets visit it 

![img](6.png)

there are two txt files lets read it 

![img](7.png)

seems like two users have been communication and smb seems to be configured

![img](8.png)

seems like j password is easily crackable 

since smb is open lets use the tool to enemurate users,shares etc ..

![img](9.png)

-a enemurate all 

![img](10.png)

we found a share named Anonymous , lets view it using smbclient 

![img](11.png)

There is a file named staff.txt lets get that file to our system and view it 

![img](12.png)

we found the username name jan and kay , since we know that jay password is crackable , so use hydra over ssh to crack jay password

![img](13.png)

We successfully found the jay password , lets login into ssh 

![img](14.png)

in kay user directory there is a file named pass.bak ,but we cannot able to read the file since our permission is denied 

![img](15.png)

tried sudo -l but user jay cannot run sudo on this machine 

so lets search for the files owned by user kay

![img](16.png)

lets see we can able to read kay ssh id_rsa key 

![img](17.png)

Lets copy the ssh rsa key to our system and login into user kay over ssh with id_rsa key

run command: chmod 600 <file_name>

![img](18.png)

seems like the key is passphrase protected , lets try to crack it using john 

first we need to convert the key into the hash format that john can understand 

![img](19.png)

now lets crack the passpharase

![img](20.png)

we successfully got the passphase

now lets login into ssh as user kay with the id_rsa key and passphase

![img](21.png)

![img](22.png)

We successfully find the password
